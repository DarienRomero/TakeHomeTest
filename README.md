Take Home Test

This project is intended to show the git commit history of the same project

## Getting Started

In order to build a debug this project, verify you have Flutter installed. Use flutter doctor and verify you have a 'check' in all items (Except maybe in a connected device item). It's also important to have Visual Studio Code installed (preferred).

The first time you open the project with Visual Studio Code it will ask you to update packages. If that alert doesn't appear, go to pubspec.yaml file and press ctrl + s in windows.

Build and test the project freely.
